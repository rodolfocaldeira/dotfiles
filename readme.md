# My (Rodolfo's) dotfiles

## Install

To install simply do:

- `git clone git@bitbucket.org:rodolfocaldeira/dotfiles.git`
- `cd dotfiles`
- copy the `git/gitconfig.symlink.example` to `git/gitconfig.symlink` and add your details
- `sh install.sh` 

The install script will symlink the files to your home directory. That's it you're done.

If you are a zsh fan, don't forget to install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) first.
